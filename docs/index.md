### Pickling and Structured Error Handling 
## Introduction  
In this module, we learned more about working text and binary files, specifically reading and appending data to them. We also explored structured error handling as well as markdown language.  
## Questions
1.	What are the benefits of putting built-in Python command into functions?  
Multiple actions can be performed with one function call.  
2.	What are the benefits of using structured error handling?  
Structured error handling allows you to create errors that are much more readable to users when users may introduce new bugs into your code as a result of their inputs.   
3.	What are the differences between a text file and a binary file?  
Text files save data as text strings that are human readable while binary saves them in smaller non-human readable formats.  
4.	How is the Exception class used?  
Exception classes are used to automatically fill information related to the error that caused the exception.  
5.	How do you "derive" a new class from the Exception class?  
Along the structured hierarchy of Exception classes, there are more specific “derived” classes that inherit the properties of the overarching parent, or base, class.  
6.	When might you create a class derived from the Exception class?  
If you wanted to dissuade the user from using specific values that you find undesirable, but are otherwise sound in the code, you might want to create a class with a custom error message.  
7.	What is the Markdown language?  
Markdown is a formatting language.  
8.	How do you use Markdown on a GitHub webpage?  
You use Markdown to format your text and then GitHub uses Jekyll to automagically convert it into a static HTML page.  
## Pickling and Structured Error Handling Code
For this week’s module, we created script to illustrate pickling and structured error handling.
